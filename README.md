# Instructions for Running the Server
To run this server locally, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository for this project:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd express-regex-server
Install the required dependencies using npm:

Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on the default port 3000. You can also specify a different port using the PORT environment variable.

Once the server is running, you should see a confirmation message in the console:

arduino
Copy code
Server is running on port 3000
Open a web browser or use an API client (such as Postman) to test the server with different URL variations.

# Explanation of Regular Expressions in Route Paths
Regular expressions are used in route paths to match multiple URL patterns efficiently. In this Express server, we have implemented a route that uses a regular expression to match both /user and /username URLs.

Here's how it works:

javascript
Copy code
app.get('/user(name)?', (req, res) => {
  if (req.params.name) {
    // If 'name' is present in the URL, it will be captured as a parameter.
    res.send(`Hello, ${req.params.name}!`);
  } else {
    // If 'name' is not present, it will match '/user' and respond accordingly.
    res.send('Hello, anonymous user!');
  }
});
In the route path 'user(name)?', the regular expression (name)? means that the part inside parentheses name is optional. The ? makes the preceding element (name) optional, so the route matches both /user and /username.

If a URL like /user is requested, req.params.name will be undefined, and it will respond with "Hello, anonymous user!".
If a URL like /username is requested, req.params.name will contain the value "username", and it will respond with "Hello, username!".
Regular expressions allow us to handle variations of the URL pattern with a single route, making our code more concise and flexible.
